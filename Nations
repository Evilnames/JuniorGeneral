'World' is the collection of assets.
'Assets' can be anything that describes the world.
Assets can be assigned to other assets.

Assets are types of 'things'.

A Type is given a specific attribute pool that they all have and that are overriden at the asset level.

World -> Type -> Asset -> Attribute

I.E. 

Type : Flag
	Attributes
		->Color
		->Size
		->Shape
		->Description
		->Owner

An asset can always be 'owned' by another asset.

All attributes can be set with in game date ranges.


All assets can have notes and filler about them which can be added too specific eras etc.

You can set 'Eras' with specific dates to say 'In the X Era'

Events are collections of 'assets' being assigned too a specific action in the history.

For example : 
'We attacked the town of Asett'.

Event #1234
Assets Assigned : Asett, General Boregard, Alpha Man
